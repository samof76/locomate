# Locomate

Locomate is my personal automation playbook just to ensure my ubuntu laptop's packages are tracked. And all installation of packages are done through this playbook. Creation of different roles makes sense, to the track as packages sets.

This repo is also a general test repo for other things like jenkins triggers, workflow automation, etc.

This is just for test merges! One more test!!!
